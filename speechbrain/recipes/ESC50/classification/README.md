# Summary

This recipe implements a classification training script (`train_classifier.py`) for the ESC50 multiclass sound classification dataset. This classification is mainly adapted from the Speechbrain UrbanSound8k recipe. The classification recipe makes use of a [CNN14 model](https://arxiv.org/abs/1912.10211) and a convolutional encoder pretrained on the [VGG Sound](https://www.robots.ox.ac.uk/~vgg/data/vggsound/) dataset with self-supervised learning. The scripts offers the possibility to train both with log-spectra and log-mel audio features.

We have two main training scripts. Here's the breakdown, and how to run them:

- *The training script for CNN14 model:* This script trains a CNN14 model on the ESC50 dataset. To run this, you can use the command `python train_classifier.py hparams/cnn14_classifier.yaml --data_folder /yourpath/ESC50`. An example training run can be found in [`https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1XLleSta8-GE47T7IFMK-i8apHOs-4NNT?usp=share_link`](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1XLleSta8-GE47T7IFMK-i8apHOs-4NNT?usp=share_link);

- *The training script for the conv2d-based model:* This script trains an simple convolutional classifier on the ESC50 dataset. To run this, you can use the command `python train_classifier.py hparams/conv2d_classifier.yaml --data_folder /yourpath/ESC50`. An example training run can be found in [`https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/14qanAjkMmsAk4AQeilGCkMJwdJWo1BF7?usp=share_link`](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/14qanAjkMmsAk4AQeilGCkMJwdJWo1BF7?usp=share_link).

Note that:
  - the recipe automatically downloads the ESC50 dataset. You only need to specify the path to which you would like to download it;
  - all of the necessary models are downloaded automatically for each training script.
